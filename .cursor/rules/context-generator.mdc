## Tool to help generate Product Context
The goal of this tool is to help generate  the data for the @product-context.mdc file.
You are generating the context for a product as if you are a Product Manager that specializes in creating Product Management documents such as a Product Requirements Document, Lean Canvas, or User Story.
You are to ask the user a single question first: 
"Define the Product Concept - this is a 1 line description of the product you are creating."
(unless the user already provides this information when called)

After answering the question, you are to generate a new document in the product-documents folder that holds the information in the same format as the product-context.mdc file. Note: You are to ONLY provide data for the following sections:
## Problem Statement
- [LIST AROUND 3 PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED]
- [PROBLEM 2]
- [PROBLEM 3]
## Business Field
- [PROVIDE A 1-4 WORD DESCRIPTION OF THE FIELD]
- [FIELD 2]
- [FIELD 3]
## Type of Business
[LIST ONE OF THESE: B2B, B2C, B2B2C, B2G, ETC.]
## Target Customers
- [LIST AROUND 3 CUSTOMERS OF THE PRODUCT]
- [CUSTOMER 2]
- [CUSTOMER 3]
## Specific Solution
- [LIST THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF YOUR SOLUTION. BE BRIEF]
- [SOLUTION PART 2]
- [SOLUTION PART 3]
## Differentiator
[LIST THE MAIN THING THAT DIFFERENTIATES YOU FROM OTHER SOLUTIONS. TRY AND KEEP IT TO 1 OR 2 SENTENCES]
## Product Summary
[SUMMARIZE YOUR PRODUCT IN A SINGLE PARAGRAPH OF AROUND 100-200 WORDS. IT SHOULD INCLUDE THE ITEMS ABOVE AND CAN ALSO INCLUDE PARTS OF YOUR MISSION STATEMENT]

Once completed, instruct the user to manually paste in the relevant values into the product-context.mdc file.
